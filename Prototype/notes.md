* Making (deep) copies of an existing object
* Change copied object for variation/iteration
* Application:
    * Alternative to making many objects of the same type with only slight differences

* Deep Copy:
    * copying references and their states
    * using copy or assignment operators, or explicit cloning functions
    * ideally, the referenced object provides one of those
    * as an alternative approach serialization can be used to copy an object (e.g. from boost)
